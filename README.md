# Pseudocompiler
A compiler for pseudocode, based on the [OCR specification](https://https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202654-pseudocode-guide.pdf) [[backup link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200118155656/https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202654-pseudocode-guide.pdf)].

## Scope of work
The only book on compiler design I have was published in 1977 so if somethings seems odd, it's probably that. 

1. Lexical analysis
2. Translation
